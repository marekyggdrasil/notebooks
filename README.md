This is an (un)organized collection of some Jupyter notebooks I drafted. I am not yet sure where to put them so (totally temporarily) I just dump them all in this repository.

Correct notebooks:

* [bloch sphere rotations](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marekyggdrasil/notebooks/blob/master/bloch-sphere-rotations.ipynb)

Debugging stage notebooks: N/A

Planned notebooks:

* tight-binding model approximation
